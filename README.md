========================

This repo is for reference purposes only. Nothing seen here should be used as a firm codebase for any new project; however, it is encouraged that others utilize techniques shown here for their own purposes.

This upcoming season, Git will be used to track a single autonomous project. No longer will code revisions float around on different flash drives and machines...
